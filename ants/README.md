# Ants Vs. SomeBees
This project implement a tower defense game similar to PopCap Games' Plants Vs. Zombies, in which ants(player) protect their territory against the evil beesâ€™ invasion.   
In this game, Bees either try to move toward the end of the territory tunnel or they sting ants in their way. As the ant queen, the player **populate** ants' colony with the bravest ants you can muster. Ants perform **a different action** depending on their **type**, such as throwing leaves at the bees. The game **ends** either when a bee reaches the end of the tunnel or ant queen (you lose), or the entire bee flotilla has been vanquished (you win).
