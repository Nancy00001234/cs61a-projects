# CS 61A: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
Institution: UC Berkeley  
Instructor:  John DeNero  
An introduction to programming and computer science focused on abstraction techniques as means to manage program complexity. 
Techniques include:  
Techniques include procedural abstraction; control abstraction using recursion, higher-order functions, generators, and streams; data abstraction using interfaces, objects, classes, and generic operators; and language abstraction using interpreters and macros. The course exposes students to programming paradigms, including functional, object-oriented, and declarative approaches. It includes an introduction to asymptotic analysis of algorithms.   
**Here are several significant programming projects in this coursesï¼šThe Game of Hog, Yelp Maps, and Ants Vs. SomeBees**
